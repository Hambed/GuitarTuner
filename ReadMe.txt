This is the guitar tuner project directory!

This repository is responsible for the front and back end of webserver hosted on my raspberry pi.

It will allow me to take frequency data from the tuner over bluetooth and display it on a webpage by storing the data in an sql database.

You will need to sign in and the tuner data will be stored under the signed in user.
